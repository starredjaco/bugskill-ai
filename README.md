## ⚡ Zero External Dependencies

All core utilities, dataset search tools, and primary skill scripts are written natively using the **Python 3 Standard Library** (Python 3.8+):

- [`search_reports.py`](search_reports.py) (`json`, `argparse`, `pathlib`, `collections`)
- [`hackerone_public.py`](hackerone_public.py) (`urllib.request`, `base64`, `json`, `argparse`)
- [`Personal-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/*`](Personal-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/) (`urllib.request`, `threading`, `json`, `argparse`, `ipaddress`, `subprocess`)

No third-party packages or `pip install` steps are required for core operations.

## 🤖 Universal Agent Skills Framework ("Using It")

Every skill in this repository contains structured instructions and workflows making it compatible across all major agent environments.

### 1. Cross-Agent Compatibility Matrix

| AI Agent Platform | Global / Personal Scope | Project / Repository Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/` | `.gemini/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` |
| **Google Antigravity** | `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` | `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` |
| **ChatGPT / Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/` | `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` |
| **Cursor / VS Code** | `@mention SKILL.md` | `.cursorrules` / `.vscode/` |

---

### 2. One-Command Universal Sync

Install all skills into your local agent environment with a single command:

#### Linux / macOS (Bash / Zsh):
```bash
# Sync ALL skills to Claude Code (Project Scope)
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r "Awesome-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/"* .claude/skills/
cp -r "Personal-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/"* .claude/skills/

# Sync ALL skills to Claude Code (Global Scope)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r "Awesome-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/"* ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r "Personal-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/"* ~/.claude/skills/

# Sync ALL skills to Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity & Codex
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r "Awesome-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/"* ~/.agents/skills/
cp -r "Personal-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills/"* ~/.agents/skills/
```

#### Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Sync ALL skills to Claude Code (Project Scope)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ".claude\skills"
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "Awesome-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills\*" ".claude\skills\"
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "Personal-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills\*" ".claude\skills\"

# Sync ALL skills to Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity & Codex
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$HOME\.agents\skills"
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "Awesome-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills\*" "$HOME\.agents\skills\"
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "Personal-Claude-Code-Agent-Skills\*" "$HOME\.agents\skills\"
```

---

### 3. Using with Claude Code

#### Direct Slash Commands
```text
/403Bypass
/SubdomainEnum
/ApexDiscovery
/JsAnalyzer
/TabletopExercise
/otp-bruteforce-testing
/url-parser-confusion-testing
/stack-bounds-format-auditing
```

#### Natural Prompting (Auto-Invocation)
Claude Code automatically indexes skill descriptions and activates them dynamically when you describe relevant security tasks:

> *"Perform subdomain enumeration and prioritize live targets for `example.com`."*
> *"Audit our authentication API for OTP brute-force bypasses."*

---

### 4. Using with Gemini CLI & Google Antigravity

- **Auto-Discovery:** Antigravity and Gemini CLI automatically load and execute any skill located in `.agents/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/`.
- **Natural Execution:** Prompt the agent with the target domain or source code to audit.

---

### 5. Using with ChatGPT / Codex CLI

- Codex CLI reads skills from `.agents/skills/` or `~/.codex/skills/`.
- List active skills with `codex /skills`.

---

### 6. Using with Cursor / VS Code

- Add skill references in `.cursorrules` or `@mention` any `SKILL.md` file directly in the chat panel.

---

## 🔎 Offline Report Search & Intelligence CLI (`search_reports.py`)

Search and analyze the **9,950+ disclosed reports** dataset offline with sub-second execution:

```bash
# 1. Global keyword search
python search_reports.py "OTP"
python search_reports.py "IDOR"
python search_reports.py "SSRF"

# 2. Filter by severity and minimum bounty
python search_reports.py "bypass" --severity critical --min-bounty 2500

# 3. Filter by CWE category
python search_reports.py --cwe "CWE-307"
python search_reports.py --cwe "CWE-79" --limit 10

# 4. Filter by target company/program
python search_reports.py --program "shopify" --severity high

# 5. Inspect deep report details by ID
python search_reports.py --id 3265780
python search_reports.py --id 2551512

# 6. Display high-level dataset statistics
python search_reports.py --stats

# 7. Output structured JSON for scripts and CI/CD pipelines
python search_reports.py "RCE" --severity critical --json
```

---

## ⚡ HackerOne Hacktivity Downloader (`hackerone_public.py`)

To refresh or append newly disclosed reports directly from the HackerOne REST API:

1. Obtain your API Identifier and Token from [HackerOne Settings -> API](https://hackerone.com/settings/api).
2. Set your environment variables:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
export H1_API_IDENTIFIER="YOUR_IDENTIFIER"
export H1_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:H1_API_IDENTIFIER="YOUR_IDENTIFIER"
$env:H1_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
```

3. Run the downloader:

```bash
# Download latest 10 pages (500 reports)
python hackerone_public.py --max-pages 10

# Download all disclosed reports (0 = unlimited)
python hackerone_public.py --max-pages 0 --output hackerone_public_reports.json
```
